# âœ¨ Features Implemented - Full-Stack Blog Post Manager

This document provides a detailed overview of the functionalities and design elements implemented in the Blog Post Manager application, highlighting both core requirements and advanced (bonus) features.

## ðŸš€ Core Functionality

### 1. Blog Post CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
-   **Create New Posts**:
    -   A **multi-step, interactive form** guides the user through creating a new blog post.
    -   Includes fields for Title, Summary, Author, Tags, and Content.
    -   **Real-time input validation** ensures data integrity.
    -   A custom **toggle switch** allows users to set a post as 'Published' or 'Draft'.
-   **View All Posts**:
    -   Displays all available blog posts in a **futuristic, dynamically glowing list/grid format**.
    -   Each post entry is a unique, angular "fragment" with an **animated border glow** and inner light pulse on hover.
    -   Includes quick-view details like Title, Summary, Views, Author, and Tags.
-   **View Individual Post Details**:
    -   Clicking on a post navigates to a dedicated detail page.
    -   The page features a **stunning, high-tech display panel** with a central, pulsing target marker.
    -   Prominent, glowing title, detailed content, metadata (views, author, date, published status), and glowing tag chips.
    -   Includes "Edit Post" and "Delete Post" actions.
-   **Edit Existing Posts**:
    -   A **multi-step editing form** (similar to the create form) is pre-filled with the post's current data.
    -   Allows modification of all post fields with validation.
-   **Delete Posts**:
    -   Provides a clear confirmation prompt before deleting a post.

### 2. Search & Filtering
-   **Real-time Search**: Users can efficiently search for posts by title, content, or tags using a dedicated search input.
-   **All Posts Button**: Resets the search filters to display all posts.

## ðŸ’Ž Advanced Features (Maximizing Bonus Points!)

### 1. **Docker Containerization**
-   **Full Multi-Container Setup**: The entire backend (Micronaut API and PostgreSQL database) is containerized using Docker.
-   **Docker Compose**: Simplifies the build and deployment, allowing the entire application stack to be launched with a single command (`docker-compose up --build`).
-   **Data Persistence**: Utilizes a named Docker volume for PostgreSQL data, ensuring all created blog posts persist across container restarts.

### 2. **Comprehensive Analytics Dashboard**
-   **Visually Stunning Control Panel**: A completely custom-designed, holographic-style dashboard inspired by futuristic UI/HUDs.
-   **Key Metrics**: Displays real-time data for:
    -   Total Posts
    -   Published Posts
    -   Total Views
    -   Average Views per Post
-   **Dynamic Visualizations**:
    -   A **central, animated wireframe globe/data core** that pulses and rotates.
    -   **Metric cards** with glowing, circular progress indicators and dynamic horizontal bars.
    -   Strategic **red tints** highlight critical or low-performing metrics (e.g., low average views per post).
    -   **Animated connecting data lines** that flow between elements.

### 3. **Interactive View Counter**
-   Each time a post's detail page is accessed, its `viewCount` is automatically incremented in the backend, demonstrating real-time analytics tracking.

### 4. **Responsive Design**
-   The entire frontend application is meticulously designed to be fully responsive, adapting gracefully to various screen sizes (desktops, tablets, mobile phones) using CSS media queries.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Highlights (Frontend Aesthetic)

The frontend boasts an **ultra-futuristic, holographic, and ethereal design** that sets it apart.

-   **Blue-Themed Color Palette**: A consistent and captivating theme of deep blues, electric cyans, and neon blues, with strategic, impactful tints of red for alerts and accents.
-   **Dynamic Background**:
    -   An immersive, dark background with subtly animated geometric grids (matrix grid).
    -   Shimmering light particles and moving light trails that react to cursor movement, creating a "living" environment.
    -   Animated circuit pathways, scanner systems, and energy cores add depth and a high-tech ecosystem feel.
    -   Holographic panels display real-time blog management statistics.
-   **Interactive Cursor**: A normal (circular), softly glowing cursor that harmonizes with the ethereal background.
-   **Elegant Typography**: A blend of futuristic fonts (`Orbitron`, `Rajdhani`, `Space Grotesk`, `Cinzel`, `Montserrat`, `Poppins`, `JetBrains Mono`) chosen for their sophisticated tech-world aesthetic.
-   **Glassmorphism & Glowing Elements**:
    -   Translucent, blurred cards, forms, and panels (e.g., `futuristic-blog-entry`, `view-post-display`, `form-container`, `analytics-dashboard`).
    -   Dynamic hover animations, including rotating border glows, inner light pulses, and subtle lifting effects.
    -   Glowing text, buttons, and input fields that react to user interaction.
-   **Segmented UI Elements**: Buttons and cards feature unique `clip-path` shapes, moving beyond standard rectangles to enhance the futuristic look.
